14th star about

History books tell us that local Vermonter and beer enthusiast Ethan Allen was a leader in the effort to make Vermont the fourteenth star on the U.S. flag in 1791. And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.

Today, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.

14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.

We currently produce about 28 barrels of beer a month (about 900 gallons) in small batches from original recipes.

What makes 14th Star’s beers stand out? Well, the care with which we handle our beer throughout the brewing process, coupled with our desire to brew the best beer humanly possible. More than that, however, we are dedicated to strengthening our local community and the Vermont Beer community as a whole. We understand that we are part of a tradition of brewing fantastic beer here in Vermont and our goal is to continue to push the bar higher.

But that’s not it. Not entirely.

You see – at this size, we can brew whatever we want to brew, without the shackles of order fulfillment from a large distributor. In 9 months, we’ve brewed a Pale Ale, a Honey IPA (with honey sourced from right here in Franklin County), a Cascade IPA, a Golden Wheat, a Roasted Porter, an Amber Ale (Valor), a Citrus APA (1493), a Brown Ale, and a Winter Warmer. These beers pop into our rotation as we get the itch to brew them.

What makes our beer special is that we can let our imaginations go – brewing beers that many in the area have never tried or heard about. We’re also open to suggestions.

If you have a suggestion on a beer we should brew, shoot us an email: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.

We look forward to continuing to provide the greater St Albans area with quality craft beer. Cheers!


alchemist

Who We Are

The Alchemist is a small, family run brewery specializing in fresh, unfiltered IPA.

We are currently focused on brewing one beer perfectly – Heady Topper, an American Double IPA.
Glorious Hops

We love hops – that’s why our flagship Double IPA, Heady Topper, is packed full of them.  Heady Topper was designed to showcase the complex flavors and aromas these flowers produce.

The Alchemist has been brewing Heady Topper since 2003.  This Double IPA is not intended to be the strongest or most bitter DIPA.  It is brewed to give you wave after wave of hop flavor without any astringent bitterness.  We brew Heady Topper with a proprietary blend of six hops – each imparting its own unique flavor and aroma.

Take a big sip of Heady and see what hop flavors you can pick out.  Orange?  Tropical Fruit? Pink Grapefruit? Pine? Spice? There is just enough malt to give this beer some backbone, but not enough to take the hops away from the center stage.
Brewing

For eight years, Heady Topper was served on tap exclusively at our seven barrel brewpub in downtown Waterbury.

In early 2011 we built the Alchemist Cannery, a 15 barrel brewery and canning line, for the production of our flagship IPA.  The first cans of Heady Topper rolled off the line just two days after Tropical Storm Irene demolished The Alchemist Pub and Brewery.

Today we brew 120 barrels per week in eight 15 barrel batches.  We never hold back inventory, and we move all of our beer weekly in a concerted effort to provide the freshest, hoppiest packaged IPA on the market.

harpoon
We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because—like today—we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.

There was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.

We still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.

We look forward to having a beer with you soon!

Cheers,

hill farmstead
Hill Farmstead Brewery is the culmination of many years of travel and insight—of experience and education—of friendships and explorations.

The brewery is the revival and continuation of 220 years of Hill heritage and hand crafted history in North Greensboro, Vermont.

Its logo is retrieved from a sign that once hung in Aaron Hill's (our great(x3) grandfather) tavern, just up the hill, in the early 1800s.

longtrail
The Long Trail Brewing Company began its mission to brew high quality craft beer in November 1989. A humble beginning in the basement of the old Bridgewater Woolen Mill along the Ottauquechee River in the Green Mountains of Vermont was soon outgrown so the brewery packed up and “Hit the Trail” up the road to a riverside hay field where they now reside.

Long Trail takes the words "Environmentally Conscious” very seriously. Appreciation for our surroundings and an understanding of the resource limitations of our local environment have inspired our company to consider ways to minimize the environmental impact our brewery has on our area. All spent grain and spent hops are fed to local dairy cattle as a valuable food supplement, steam from the brewing process is condensed into hot water and the thermal energy is used to heat water for the next brewing cycle saving up to 2,000 gallons of propane a month. By combining the very best ingredients available - like pure Vermont drinking water - and environmentally minded brewing processes with a genuine passion for brewing high quality craft beer, Long Trail proudly produces an extraordinary Family of Fine Ales.

madison
The Madison family has deep roots in the Bennington, Vermont. As locals growing up and living in the area, the Madisons have deep ties to the community and in the early 1990′s the family decided to purchase what was then a burned out storefront in Bennington’s historic downtown and convert it into the area’s first brew pub. “My brother Mark was part of the inspiration” says co-owner Mel Madison. “He become passionate about brewing beer as a hobby… and that let us to the idea of starting a brew pub.”

From those humble beginnings, the brewery has developed six regular brews plus a seasonal brew. To complement the brewing is the lunch and dinner offerings as well as Madison’s own home-made chips – a favorite at the bar or anyplace. Now into it’s second decade of operation, the brew pub has become a Bennington fixture and a favorite amongst the locals. We encourage you to stop in and discover for yourself everything Madisons Brewing Company has to offer!

norwich inn
 Our Brew Master, Jeremy Hebert is proud to welcome you to the Brewery at the Norwich Inn, home of Jasper Murdock Ales. Our Ales have won 4 silver and a gold medal in recent years at the Great International Beer Competition.

President James Monroe dined at the Norwich Inn in 1817 while on a horseback tour of the New England frontier. Alas, history does not record whether he had a beer. But if he did, it was most likely brewed at the Inn. Vermont had no commercial breweries at the time, and the local beers were brewed in very small batches. Even the biggest copper kettle provided just enough ale for the brewer and his guests.

In 1993, this Vermont brewery tradition was revived at the Norwich Inn when Jasper Murdock's Alehouse began producing traditional English-style ales in 5-gallon glass jugs. By 1995, an historic livery building was renovated and outfitted with a new four-barrel brew house, enabling 125-gallon batches. Though the vessels are now larger, we remain one of the smallest breweries in America.

Jasper Murdock's Ales and Lagers are crafted from the finest malts and hops, occasionally including hops grown in our own hop garden here at the Inn. Because filtration can strip flavor and body from a beer, the yeast is allowed to settle out naturally in an extended cold-aging period to ensure that all the goodness reaches your palate. The beer is then pumped underground from the beer cellars to our pub at the Inn.

Our beers are sold only at the Inn. Bottled brew in many of our varieties is available by the 22 ounce bottle, by the case or the 5 gallon keg. Call ahead and place your an order to pick up when you come to the Inn.

trapp family
More than a decade ago Johannes von Trapp started thinking about brewing his own beer, for guests of the resort. His dream was to produce an American version of the tasty Lager he has enjoyed over the years on his trips to the countryside near his ancestral Austrian home.

Johannes' dream became reality in the Spring of 2010, with the opening of the Trapp Family Brewery. The modest facility (60,000 or so gallons a year) is located in the lower level of the DeliBakery (formerly the Austrian Tea Room), where draughts of the heavenly concoction will be available year round.

trout river
Trout River Brewing was founded in July 1996 by Dan and Laura Gates. We began brewing in early December of that year. We still own and operate this microbrewery in the northeastern region of Vermont--The Northeast Kingdom! Come visit this special and beautiful place and taste all that the Kingdom has to offer.

Trout River Brewing prides itself on creating and serving fresh, all natural, premium ales and lagers. Our beers are made with pure Vermont water, the best imported and domestic malts and hops, and quality yeasts. Nothing else is added and we take nothing away!

At Trout River Brewing, we believe that the naturally occuring settling of unfiltered brews results in a more flavorful and complex taste. As well, filtration robs the aroma which is a very important part of the beer experience. Therefore, we do not filter our beers!

vpb
The Vermont Pub & Brewery, the state's oldest craft brewery, opened its doors on November 11, 1988 and has been one of Burlington's most popular establishments ever since.

Our beers are fresh and wholesome. All of our beers are unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unadulterated. The pub brews with artisanal imported malts and fresh hops and we do not cheapen the product by rushing the process. We are famous for a reason: Quality.

"The Vermont Pub and Brewery is always coming up with new formulas to make a better beer and they have accomplished this repeatedly… You are encouraged the next time you visit Burlington Vermont to sit down in The Vermont Pub and Brewery and order a basket of fried oysters and ask the server to pick a beer to complement them. You will not be disappointed."
