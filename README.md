Custom Wordpress theme based on: [`_s`, or `underscores`](http://underscores.me/). In the author's own words: "I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.  My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme."

#  Goals  #

N.B. this site is now a JQuery-free zone, which was the primary driver in this re-write.  Free bonus is that the `PHP`, and thus the `HTML`, was considerably tightened and stream-lined, so the adage **Performance is a Feature** is firmly in place.
